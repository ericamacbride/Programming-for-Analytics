```

a. Based on your analysis, which cityâ€™s housing is most affordable? Least affordable?
Houston is the most affordable. New York is the least affordable.
b. Which cities saw the largest change in prices over the past 5 years? Which city has remained more
consistent (i.e., no huge swings up or down in home values)?
New York and Denver have seen the largest change in the last five years with an increase of nearly 200,000. From the looks of it, Chicago has stayed the most consistent. I would consider Houston to also be quite consistent, but looks like they have seen a somewhat larger increase in the five year time period.
c. During the market downturn in 2012, which cities were most impacted? Which cities have
recovered?
New York and Chicago were most impacted. New York has recovered significantly, Chicago is slowly increasing since 2012 but not at the rate New York did. Denver was not impacted harshly in the 2012 downturn, but has seen significant growth since.
